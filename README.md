# Network-as-Code SD-WAN Terraform

Use Terraform to operate and manage SD-WAN infrastructure using purpose built modules.

## Setup

Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (> 1.3.0), and the following Python tools:

- [iac-validate](https://github.com/netascode/iac-validate)

```shell
pip install iac-validate
```

Set environment variables pointing to vManage:

```shell
export SDWAN_USERNAME=admin
export SDWAN_PASSWORD=cisco123
export SDWAN_URL=https://10.1.1.1
```

Encrypted secrets (`$CRYPT_CLUSTER$...`) might have to be updated like documented [here](https://wwwin-github.cisco.com/AS-Customer/sdwanac).

## Initialization

```shell
terraform init
```

This command will download all the required providers and modules from the public Terraform Registry ([https://registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io)).

## Pre-Change Validation

```shell
iac-validate data/
```

This command performs syntactic and semantic validation of YAML input files located in `data/`.

## Terraform Plan/Apply

```shell
terraform apply
```

This command will apply/deploy the desired configuration.

## Testing

```shell
iac-test --data ./data --data ./defaults.yaml --templates ./tests/templates --output ./tests/results --filters ./jinja_filters/
```
* All data YAML files (```--data```) will be first combined into single data structure provided as input to templating process
* Each template  in the ```--templates``` will be rendered and written to the output folder, keeping the folder structure
* After all templates have been rendered Pabot will execute all test suites in parallel and create a test report in the  ```--output``` path.
* ```--filters``` DIRECTORY Path to Jinja filters. Custom Jinja filters can be used by providing a set of Python classes where each filter is implemented as a separate Filter class in a .py file located in the --filters path. 

This command will render and execute a set of tests and provide the results in a report (`tests/results/report.html`).

## Terraform Destroy

```shell
terraform destroy
```

This command will delete all the previously created configuration.
